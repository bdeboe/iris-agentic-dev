"""Report `iris_*` / tool-shaped names in prose and error strings that no tool answers to.

Prints one TSV line per finding: path, line, name. Silent when clean.
Called by scripts/gates/antipatterns.sh (check: tool-name-refs).

Why this is a functional check and not a style one: agents read these strings and act on
them. `CODE_EDIT_BLOCKED` told callers to use `iris_document`, a tool that has never
existed, so the remediation advice was a dead end for every caller who followed it.

The registry is `tools::write_gate::CLASSIFICATION` — the router's own list, which is what
dispatch actually matches on. Deriving the name set from anything else (a doc table, a
second constant) reproduces the defect this catches: two artifacts agreeing with each
other is not evidence that either is right.
