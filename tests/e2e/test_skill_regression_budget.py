"""The nightly has to be a breakage guard, and has to stay cheap enough to run nightly.

Two histories are in this file.

From 2026-08-29 to 2026-09-07 every scheduled run finished as `cancelled` at exactly 1h15m — the
`timeout-minutes: 75` on a single sequential job. Run 34093536537 got through five of nine skills
in 68 minutes. Sharding fixed the clock. It did not fix what the job was measuring: six of nine
skills printed 0.00 against 0.00 and the job reported success, and then runs 34744344877,
34817991701 and 34939912456 failed three nights running on Δs smaller than the corpus could
resolve.

121 FR-016 settles it by changing the question. The nightly asks whether the harness runs, whether
the binary still advertises its tools, and whether a named canary set still passes — three
assertion-scored tasks, no grading call, no lift. Lift is reported by the full benchmark, at a
release and before a conference, over a corpus large enough to support it. So these tests assert
the nightly's shape and its silence about lift, and the old sharding assertions are gone with the
job they described.
