"""Every command the setup skill tells an agent to run has to exist.

A skill is prose until something reads it, and the thing that reads it is a model that will
run what it says without checking. A subcommand that was renamed, a tool that never existed,
an `--args` key the schema rejects: all of that ships silently, and the failure lands on
someone installing for the first time, which is the worst audience to fail in front of.

These checks read the skill the way the CLI would: subcommands against `--help`, tool names
against `tool --list`, and each `--args` payload against that tool's own JSON schema. No IRIS
needed — the schemas come from the binary's router, not from a connection.

The binary comes from `IAD_BINARY`, falling back to `target/debug/iris-agentic-dev`. When
neither exists the tests skip, because a checkout with nothing built cannot answer.
