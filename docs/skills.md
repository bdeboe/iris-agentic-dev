# Skills

Skills are concise instruction files that teach your AI assistant ObjectScript-specific
patterns and common mistakes. They work with or without the MCP server.

Skills and the MCP server are independent. Installing the `iris-agentic-dev` binary
installs no skills. Skills are opt-in, managed separately, and can live in any repo.
Domain-specific skill packs (like Keshav Iyer's
[IKO skill](https://gitlab.iscinternal.com/fschwich/isc-iko-skill)) are the intended
pattern for opinionated or team-specific skills.

## Benchmark results

Tested with Claude Sonnet 4.6 on the ObjectScript repair suite (22 tasks):

| Benchmark suite                | Baseline | With top skill | Lift |
| ------------------------------ | -------- | -------------- | ---- |
| ObjectScript repair (22 tasks) | 73%      | **100%**       | +27% |

The top skill is **`objectscript-review`** — a 205-word checklist that catches the 10 most
common ObjectScript mistakes before the AI writes any code.

The multi-file and SQL-quirks suites referenced in earlier versions of this table are not
yet ported to the current native benchmark harness (`iris-agentic-dev benchmark`) — only
the repair suite above is runnable today. See
[skills/BENCHMARKING.md](../skills/BENCHMARKING.md) to run it yourself, including a
[Limitations](../skills/BENCHMARKING.md#limitations) section covering contamination
risk, single-run variance, and single-model validation caveats.

## Installing skills

Every skill has a tier, set by `tier:` in its `SKILL.md` frontmatter:

- **core**: the ten skills most ObjectScript work needs. The Claude Code plugin ships these, and a bare `skill install` installs these.
- **extra**: the other 23. Install them by name or with `--all`. The `iris-agentic-dev` skill lists each one with a line on when to load it, and `skill_describe` reads any of them over MCP without installing anything.
- **internal**: skills for working on iad itself (today only `opencode-introspect`). No list shows them. Install one by name if you want it.

Install the core skills to Claude Code and OpenCode:

```bash
iris-agentic-dev skill install
```

Install core and extra (what a bare install did before 1.5.0):

```bash
iris-agentic-dev skill install --all
```

Install specific skills at any tier, target an agent, or preview first:

```bash
iris-agentic-dev skill install iris-query-plans iris-vector-ai
iris-agentic-dev skill install --agent claude-code
iris-agentic-dev skill install --agent opencode
iris-agentic-dev skill install --agent copilot   # repo-scoped; run from a git repo
iris-agentic-dev skill install --dry-run         # preview without writing
iris-agentic-dev skill install --force           # overwrite user-authored files
```

Check what's installed:

```bash
iris-agentic-dev skill list                      # every core and extra skill, with its tier
iris-agentic-dev skill list --agent claude-code
iris-agentic-dev skill status                    # managed vs user-authored
```

**Upgrading**: `brew upgrade iris-agentic-dev` (or replacing the binary directly)
updates the binary only — installed skills are not touched. After upgrading, run
`iris-agentic-dev skill install` to pick up new skills. Files that lack the
`managed_by: "iris-agentic-dev"` marker (installed before it was introduced, or
installed by other means) are skipped as unrecognized; pass `--force` once to
overwrite them and stamp them for automatic updates going forward.

**Skills left by an older install**: before 1.5.0 a bare install wrote all 34 skills. A
bare install now writes the ten core skills and deletes nothing. If it finds managed
copies of extra or internal skills in `~/.claude/skills` or the OpenCode skills
directory, it names them and stops there. Then pick one:

```bash
iris-agentic-dev skill install --all                # keep them, and keep them up to date
iris-agentic-dev skill install --prune --dry-run    # show what --prune would remove
iris-agentic-dev skill install --prune              # remove them
```

`--prune` removes only files that carry the `managed_by: "iris-agentic-dev"` marker. A
`SKILL.md` you wrote yourself under the same name stays, and so does any other file in
that skill's directory. `--prune --all` removes only internal skills. `--prune` with
skill names is refused. Copilot's `.github/instructions/` is never pruned, since it is
committed to a repo.

**VS Code Copilot**: The extension installs the binary, not the skills. Run
`iris-agentic-dev skill install --agent copilot` from a git repo root to install skills
into `.github/instructions/` — commit that directory to share with your team.

**Manual fallback** — if you prefer not to use the CLI:

**Claude Code:**

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
for skill in objectscript-review objectscript-guardrails objectscript-sql-patterns; do
  mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/$skill
  curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/intersystems-community/iris-agentic-dev/master/skills/skills/$skill/SKILL.md \
    > ~/.claude/skills/$skill/SKILL.md
done
```

**OpenCode:**

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/opencode/skills
for skill in objectscript-review objectscript-guardrails objectscript-sql-patterns; do
  mkdir -p ~/.config/opencode/skills/$skill
  curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/intersystems-community/iris-agentic-dev/master/skills/skills/$skill/SKILL.md \
    > ~/.config/opencode/skills/$skill/SKILL.md
done
```

## Skill inventory

All 34 skills below ship embedded in the binary, at every tier — no download, no IRIS connection, no
filesystem lookup. This is the whole list. Agents read a short inventory as "these are
the skills that exist" and reimplement from scratch rather than asking for one that is
missing from the table, so any skill in the binary belongs here.

`skills/skills/iris-agentic-dev/nopws-setup/SKILL.md` is a repo reference file, not a
bundled skill: discovery globs `<skills dir>/*/SKILL.md`, so a file one level deeper is
never loaded, and it is not in the embedded catalog. Read it in the repo.

"repair" scores are reproducible today via `iris-agentic-dev benchmark --suite jira`.
"SQL" and "domain" scores predate the current native harness and are not yet
re-verifiable — see [BENCHMARKING.md](../skills/BENCHMARKING.md#additional-suites-not-yet-ported).

## Skill loading caution

Some skills hurt if loaded globally:

- `objectscript-loop-patterns` measured **−19% lift** when loaded for all tasks.
- Domain skills (`iris-vector-ai`, `iris-connectivity`, `ensemble-production`) should only
  be loaded when working in those areas — loading them for general ObjectScript work adds
  noise without benefit.

See [BENCHMARKING.md](../skills/BENCHMARKING.md) for detailed per-skill results.

## MCP-backed skill registry

When the MCP server is running, the learning agent can mine your session history to propose
new skills and optimize existing ones. Use the `skill` tool:

| Tool                   | What it does                                   |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `skill` with `list`    | Show all skills in the registry                |
| `skill` with `propose` | Mine recent tool calls to propose a new skill  |
| `skill` with `search`  | Find skills relevant to a topic                |
| `skill` with `forget`  | Remove a skill from the registry               |
| `skill_community`      | Browse or install community skills from GitHub |

## Contributing a skill

Write a `SKILL.md`, run the benchmark, submit a PR with your results.

See [`skills/`](../skills/) for the full skill list, benchmark results, and
contribution guide.
